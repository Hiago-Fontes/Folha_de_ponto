### This simple project
is a Python application for time tracking. It allows you to record entries and exits, calculate hours worked, overtime, and time bank, consider breaks and holidays, and generate monthly reports. The idea is to facilitate routine organization and the creation of timesheets that can be exported to formats such as CSV, Excel, or PDF.
